      <p class="title">Dear Paula,</p>
      <p>
        You can be sure that the moment you read and will read these words, I
        miss you. Our few months have passed, where time and events brought us
        together a lot. Unfortunately, the end of this short period has come, we
        will never have the same life again, we will never live together in the
        green tower again, and we will not have our spontaneous and crazy
        adventures with our friends from 196.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you remember how you and I met? We started talking about museums at a
        certain point, and from that moment you immediately seemed interesting
        to me. I was curious to know who you are, I wanted to spend time with
        you to understand if you are really that special. We saw Van Gogh
        together, you were curious to read the labels of the operas, you were
        suited to that artistic environment. Do you remember the work “Almond Blossom”? Do you remember what I told you about that painting?
        There I couldn't take my eyes off your eyes; I didn't know whether to
        look at the painting or at you. Subconsciously, in that moment, I fell
        in love with you. I loved every time we went to the museum together,
        your curiosity attracted me. Since those days I have thought of nothing
        but you and what I really feel; Is it possible that I love you? After
        such a short time? I was in doubt, you already know that I have made
        mistakes in the past that destroyed me emotionally, therefore I decided
        to tell you. It was difficult, every time it's difficult to say
        something you feel. I'll be honest, I knew you didn't feel the same way
        about me, however, I didn't want to give up; because I know, Paula, eyes
        are just eyes until you fall in love with the ones that make you smile
        every time you look at them. And yours are of a beauty that only I can
        understand. You, in your essence and person, are beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        My confession didn’t bring me good results, you told me that I was like
        a friend to you. I was ok, well the day after I was actually devastated
        and senseless, but then I calmed down. Even though I couldn't have your
        love, I couldn't stop thinking about you. So, I did one thing, I
        influenced my universe. Every evening, before I went to sleep and every
        morning as soon as I got up, I affirmed that the universe will make my
        dreams come true. In my dreams, you were on the bed hugging me, I didn’t
        want anything else. A series of events brought us together with Maya, we
        formed an intimate trio. We went to Prague, and before that to Cologne.
        Every time I felt the same emotions, I didn't care about the fact that
        you saw me just as a friend, I felt that I was attracting you towards
        me. I started observing this for the first time one evening when we were
        playing cards, strangely you looked at me more than usual, then in
        Prague. Oh Prague, how beautiful your face was when you saw the snow for
        the first time, or all the other beautiful ones that that city showed
        us. I wanted to kiss you a lot of time in Prague, gosh I craved
        something that I knew I couldn’t have. Was the trip to Prague the one
        that gave me some hope? I don't know for sure. I only know that a few
        days after we returned home, I invited you into my room to spend some
        time alone with you, between one song and another, I understood a lot
        about you. You, who are often shy, sang with me, you, who are shy, asked
        me if we could kiss. And we did, we ended up kissing and cuddling in my
        bed; haven't I influenced my universe?
      </p>
      <p>
        The two of us together locked ourselves in a small world, our 505, where
        I could love you and you could understand what you feel for me. My god
        Paula, how happy I am that that night you decided to ask me to kiss you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that you like me; it's very difficult, I don't want you to
        suffer, I don't want you to cry... but I don't want to lose you, I don't
        want you to forget what I feel for you, and what you feel for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I have to remember you for longer than I have known you. But I can
        do it, because I feel joy when I think of you. Maybe you and I need to
        separate for now, maybe we still need to do some things for ourselves
        before we can reunite, or maybe we need to love each other from a
        distance. I don't know, it's all so spontaneous and random, I can't
        predict for sure what it will be. I want to make you a promise, I
        promise that you and I would meet as soon as we finished our studies,
        and from then on, we would no longer have to stay far away. I don't know
        how or what the future will be, but I'm sure I'll keep this promise and
        work to make it happen if you let me. Remember, the universe doesn't
        just need strong affirmations and faith, it needs action and I am
        willing to do what it takes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's true, it will never be the same again, never again our kitchen,
        never again our slow elevators, never again our rooms. In fact, I don't
        think I will ever have what I have had in these 4 months, not the same
        experiences, not the same group of people, not the same house. I want to
        bring us back, because the two of us were only ourselves in that little
        world that started in my room at 9pm, when it was just you and me, and
        that ended the next day in the morning. What do I really want? I want
        you. Because I want you to be happy, because you make me happy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please forgive my selfish desires, remember what we said to each other a
        few days before I left. I will feel the same emotions for you, despite
        being on the other side of the world. And I hope that you find no one,
        and that, in the end, you will only love me; Sorry, I'm being very
        selfish here, but it's what I want; please remember what we have talked
        about. The universe passes through us, I will influence mine, you do the
        same with yours and you will see that we will reunite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please just wait for me, it will be difficult at first, but you can do
        it. Wait and finish your studies. We don't have to be a normal cuple,
        emotions don't appear because you want them to, and they don't disappear
        just randomly. I just ask you to be patient, and I promise that our
        little world can become a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe I was too poetic in this letter? Yes, I was, but that's how I am
        when I write. I miss you so much, I miss holding you in my arms, kissing
        you and feeling your smile on my lips. I miss you so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I write this part on the day I flew to Italy, gosh I cried so much
        in your arms, I couldn’t keep it on me. You can understand what I feel,
        I have never cried so much in years, but with you I did it, you saw me
        in my most intimate moment, be glad please, no one saw me like that.
        Every time I will listen to our favourite songs I will feel happy
        thinking of you, the emotions of those songs are written in my mind and
        I will keep and guard them as my treasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember the pinky promise I made to you. I intend to respect it and
        therefore I ask you to do that too, think about me, and how we can go
        back to 505. These are just some gap years, years where we will become
        better. After this long gap me and you will be happy together.
      </p>
      <p>I love you and miss you so much, I kiss you and hug you.</p>
      <p class="end-sentence">See you after.</p>
